# Maze-Runner
A game created in Scratch as a part of the Harvard CS50 Introduction to Computer Science course


OBJECTIVE

A race with the computer controlled blue ball in a maze. 

GAME RULES 

Use the arrow keys for movement.

The arrows do not follow the default movements at all time. For this, keep track of the green arrows in the left.

The direction the green arrow points indicates the key which allows you to move upwards. 
The rest of the key movements changes accordingly in the clockwise direction.

For example :

When green arrow points up - keys follow default movements.
When greem arrow points right - right key for up
                                down key for right
                                left key for down
                                up key for left
And so on ...

Defeat the blue ball to the end.
